# OIBSIP_WebDevelopment_task2
ðŸ™Œ About the Project : 
This project is a humble tribute to one of Indiaâ€™s greatest minds â€“ Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. Built using only HTML and CSS, the page aims to highlight his life journey, achievements, and the legacy he left behind.
Itâ€™s more than just a webpage â€” itâ€™s a small effort to honor someone who continues to inspire millions through his words and work.

ðŸ§° What I Used
1. HTML5 for the structure.
2. CSS3 for styling and layout.
3. No frameworks, no JavaScript â€” just clean and simple code.

ðŸ’« Whatâ€™s Inside?
1. A beautiful header with Dr. Kalamâ€™s image and title.
2. A timeline of his major life events and achievements.
3. A section of powerful and motivational quotes.
4. Clean, calm, and respectful design to reflect his personality.

ðŸ“ˆ What I Learned : 
While building this page, I learned:
1. How to write clean and semantic HTML
2. How to style effectively with CSS
3. How to make a simple webpage look polished and responsive
4. Most importantly, I got inspired all over again by Dr. Kalam's story
